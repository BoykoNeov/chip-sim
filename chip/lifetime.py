"""Deep-level metals → minority-carrier lifetime + junction leakage (Chip / fab-game **G4b**, Tier 2).

The consequence model net doping **cannot** carry. Phase-1 dopant and G4a's mobile-ion Na both reach a
device number through the *doping/oxide-charge* channels (:mod:`chip.junction`, :mod:`chip.device`), but
a **deep-level transition metal** (Fe, Cu — :class:`chip.purification.Contamination`) is electrically a
**recombination centre**, not a dopant: it leaves the net doping essentially untouched and instead
*destroys minority-carrier lifetime* and *raises junction reverse leakage*. Zone refining scrubs these
metals superbly (their ``k`` is tiny — :mod:`chip.purification`), but whatever survives needs a **new
device output** to bite. This module is that output (plan §5a Tier 2, §6 G4 — the deferred "G4b" the
G4a build named): the metals finally become a *device* consequence — *a leaky, low-lifetime diode is how
a metal contaminant kills yield.*

This is the **loose tier**, by design (plan §7): the segregation purification of G4a is the verifiable
win, while the metal device-degradation **magnitudes** here (capture cross-sections, the clean-bulk
lifetime, the leakage calibration) are cited-but-loose — flagged, never asserted with the segregation
anchors. What *is* tight is the SRH machinery that frames them.

The Shockley–Read–Hall recombination centre
-------------------------------------------
A single trap level at ``N_t`` (cm⁻³) recombines carriers at the steady-state SRH net rate::

    U(n, p) = (p·n − n_i²) / [ τ_p0·(n + n_1) + τ_n0·(p + p_1) ]                 (cm⁻³ s⁻¹)

with ``τ_n0 = 1/(σ_n·v_th·N_t)``, ``τ_p0 = 1/(σ_p·v_th·N_t)`` the fundamental electron/hole capture
lifetimes (``σ`` the capture cross-section, ``v_th`` the carrier thermal velocity), and
``n_1 = n_i·e^{(E_t−E_i)/kT}``, ``p_1 = n_i·e^{−(E_t−E_i)/kT}`` the trap-occupancy factors
(``n_1·p_1 = n_i²``). In the **p-type bulk under low injection** (the channel/body of our n-MOS) this
collapses to a single minority-electron lifetime — the model the game consumes::

    1/τ = 1/τ_bulk + Σ_i σ_n,i·v_th·N_i + K·ρ_disl   (deep-level metals + grown-in dislocations add rates)

— the **electron** capture cross-section governs (p-type ⇒ electrons are the minority carrier); ``τ_bulk``
is the clean-material baseline. The minority-carrier **diffusion length** ``L = √(D·τ)`` falls out of it.
The ``K·ρ_disl`` term (A1, :func:`dislocation_recombination_rate`) is a *second contributor on the same
channel*: grown-in interstitial-side **dislocations** from a too-slow Czochralski pull (``ξ < ξ_t`` —
:func:`chip.czochralski.dislocation_defect_density`) are recombination centres too, so a slow pull — not
just a dirty feed — can make the diode leaky. Both default off (``ρ_disl = 0``, the seam).

The reverse junction leakage (the device killer)
------------------------------------------------
The same trap **generates** carriers where the junction is depleted (``n, p ≪ n_i``), giving the
generation-limited reverse leakage that dominates a silicon diode at room temperature::

    J_gen = q·n_i·W / (2·τ_g)              (A/cm²),   W = √(2·ε_Si·V_J/(q·N_A))  the depletion width

— ``∝ 1/τ ∝ N_metal``, so dirtier feedstock ⇒ shorter lifetime ⇒ **higher** leakage. ``W`` is the
one-sided abrupt S/D-junction depletion width at a reference junction voltage ``V_J`` (built-in +
reverse), reusing :mod:`chip.device`'s ``ε_Si``/``n_i`` and :mod:`chip.junction`'s ``q``. (We take the
generation lifetime ``τ_g ≈ τ`` for the teaching model — rigorously it weights both cross-sections; a
flagged simplification, the loose tier. The diffusion/Shockley ``J_0 ∝ n_i²/L`` component is
sub-dominant at 300 K and named, not modelled.)

Validation triad (plan §7) — what is asserted tight vs loose
------------------------------------------------------------
* **Analytical limit (tight) — the low-injection reduction of the full SRH statistics.** Like
  Czochralski's ``k→1`` or Deal–Grove's closed form, the honest analytic leg is a **limit of a
  generalization**: the full :func:`srh_rate` ``U(n, p)``, evaluated in the p-type low-injection limit
  (``Δn ≪ N_A``, midgap trap), reduces to ``τ = Δn/U → τ_n0 = 1/(σ_n·v_th·N_t)`` — and crucially the
  hole cross-section ``σ_p`` **and** the trap energy ``E_t`` *drop out*, leaving ``σ_n`` as the sole
  governing cross-section. That is the content of the leg (not solver-grade independence — there is no
  solve underneath SRH; it *is* the model). The clean limit ``N_metal = 0 ⇒ τ = τ_bulk`` is recovered
  **bit-for-bit** (the seam). Rate-additivity (``1/τ`` affine in the ``N_i``) is true *by construction*
  — a regression guard, not an anchor.
* **Conservation (tight) — detailed balance.** At thermal equilibrium ``p·n = n_i²`` the SRH numerator
  vanishes, so ``U = 0`` **exactly** — generation balances recombination — *for any* ``σ_n``, ``σ_p``,
  ``E_t``. That parameter-independence is precisely what makes it a genuine check (it cannot be fit) and
  what certifies the full-``U`` machinery the analytic reduction also rides.
* **Benchmark (loose) — the cited capture data + the textbook order.** Electron capture cross-sections
  ``σ_n`` (:data:`CAPTURE_SIGMA_N`) and the thermal velocity ``v_th`` are order-of-magnitude literature
  values (Sze, *Physics of Semiconductor Devices*; Graff, *Metal Impurities in Silicon-Device
  Fabrication*); they reproduce the **textbook scaling** — clean float-zone silicon ``τ ~ ms`` /
  ``L ~ mm``, an interstitial-iron level ``[Fe] ~ 1e12 cm⁻³`` dragging ``τ`` to a few µs — but the
  numbers are **flagged**, not asserted tight. ``τ_bulk``, ``V_J`` and the leakage calibration are
  house numbers (ADR 0005 §5).

Named scope edge (the honest ceiling)
-------------------------------------
* **Generation-limited leakage only.** ``J_gen = q·n_i·W/(2τ)`` is the room-temperature dominant term;
  the diffusion (Shockley) ``J_0`` component and any trap-assisted tunnelling are named, not modelled.
* **A single effective midgap recombination centre.** The simple ``1/τ`` uses ``σ_n`` and treats the
  metal as midgap-efficient; the full :func:`srh_rate` carries ``E_t``, but the lifetime/leakage the
  game reads assume the most-efficient (midgap) case. Real Fe_i sits off midgap — folded into the
  flagged ``σ_n``.
* **Point-defect metals, fully active.** The whole dissolved metal is taken as an active recombination
  centre. Its real fate — **precipitation / gettering at junctions** (often the actual device-killer) —
  is the named **Tier-3** edge (plan §5a), *not* modelled. This is the same active-vs-chemical ceiling
  the repo carries elsewhere ([[dopant-charge-state-diffusivity-source]]).
* **Low injection.** The single-lifetime collapse assumes ``Δn ≪ N_A`` (the off-state body); high-level
  injection (``τ → τ_n0 + τ_p0``) is out.

Units — semiconductor-conventional CGS (as :mod:`chip.device` / :mod:`chip.junction`)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``N`` in **cm⁻³**; ``σ`` in **cm²**; ``v_th`` in **cm/s** → recombination rate in **s⁻¹** and lifetime
``τ`` in **s**; ``D`` in **cm²/s** → diffusion length ``L`` in **cm** (reported µm); depletion width
``W`` in **cm**; leakage ``J_gen`` in **A/cm²** (reported nA/cm²). One unit system throughout; the same
``ε_Si``/``n_i``/``q`` the device and junction modules already use.

Validation boundary
-------------------
No shared engine — the SRH lifetime/leakage are closed forms (like Deal–Grove / Scheil / the compact
``V_t`` / Pfann), so this module's tests carry the whole triad: the low-injection reduction of the full
``U(n, p)`` (analytic), detailed balance ``U = 0`` at equilibrium (conservation), and the cited capture
cross-sections + textbook lifetime/leakage order (benchmark). The cross-sections are pinned to the cited
sources, *not* carried from memory; the calibration constants are flagged house numbers.
